YouTube Clipper
YouTube Clipper is a simple command-line tool for creating audio or video clips from any public YouTube video. Just provide a YouTube link, choose the start and end times for your clip, and decide whether you want the output as a video or just audio. The clip is saved right to your Downloads folder.

How to Use YouTube Clipper
1. Clone the Repository
To get started, you need to download this project to your computer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

bash
git clone https://github.com/rishabbora/YouTube-Clipper.git
This will create a folder called YouTube-Clipper with all the code you need.

2. Change Into the Project Directory
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
cd YouTube-Clipper
3. Run the Clipper Tool
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, you can start the tool by running:

bash
python clipper.py
The script will install any additional Python packages it needs automatically the first time you run it.

4. Follow the Prompts
Enter the link to the public YouTube video you want to clip.
Enter the start and end times for your clip in HH:MM:SS format (for example, 00:01:30).
Decide if you want audio only (type 0) or both audio and video (type 1).
Enter a name for your output file (without the extension).
The finished file will appear in your Downloads folder, as either an MP3 (audio) or MP4 (video) file depending on your choice.

Example
Suppose you want a 20-second video clip from a YouTube video:

Run python clipper.py
Paste the YouTube link, such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
Enter start time: 00:00:45
Enter end time: 00:01:05
Choose output: 1 for video
Enter a filename, for example: myclip
Find myclip.mp4 in your Downloads folder.
Notes
Only works with public, non-age-restricted YouTube videos.
The clip must be at least 5 seconds long.
All dependencies are installed automatically when you run the script.
This should help anyone clone the repo and use the YouTube Clipper right away!
